# scConGraph: a scalable cross-time Context Graph model
scConGraph is a scalable bi-layer graph model that efficiently **integrates cross-time context information**, enabling the comprehensive analysis of **tumor cell dynamic responses** from **paired perturbed or time-seiries single-cell transcriptomics**.

## System requirements
scConGraph is now available for Linux, with a Windows version planned for recent release. scConGraph requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to perform in-memory computations.

## Installation
CINEMA-OT requires `python` version 3.7+.  Install directly from pip with:

    pip install scConGraph
    
The LINE toolkit for graph embedding should be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE.git before using scConGraph. 

## Tutorial
The vignette of `scConGraph` can be found in the project [wiki](https://github.com/Li-Xinqi/scConGraph/wiki/scConGraph).
