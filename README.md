## System requirements
scConGraph is now available for Linux, with a Windows version planned for recent release. scConGraph requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to perform in-memory computations.

## Installation
CINEMA-OT requires `python` version 3.7+.  Install directly from pip with:

    pip install scConGraph
    
The LINE toolkit for graph embedding should be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE.git.
