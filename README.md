## System requirements
scConGraph is now available for Linux, with a Windows version planned for recent release. scConGraph requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to perform in-memory computations.

## Installation
CINEMA-OT requires `python` version 3.7+.  Install directly from pip with:

    pip install scConGraph
    
The GSL package for Linux should be be downloaded and installed from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.
